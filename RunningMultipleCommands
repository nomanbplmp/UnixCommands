#Running Multiple Unix Commands Let's look at some ways to run unix commands on the same command prompt. 

$ cmd1 & cmd2 & 
#This will run both commands in the background, in parallel. 

$ cmd1; cmd2 
#This will first run cmd1, and then cmd2. It is the equivalent of running cmd1 on the command prompt, pressing return, and then running cmd2 at the #next command prompt. 

$ cmd1 && cmd2 
#This will run cmd1 first. If cmd1 runs successfully (return code 0), then cmd2 is run. 

$ cmd1 | | cmd2
#This will run cmd1 first. If cmd1 runs un-successfully (non-zero return code), then cmd2 is run.
